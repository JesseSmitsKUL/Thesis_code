# Thesis: Improving the stream management in IoT by online data analysis

This code was used to implement an improved version of the stream management of IoT applications in a middleware.

## Prerequisites

  - Python 3.6(+)
  - Keras
  - Statsmodels
  - Scikit-learn
  
## Introduction
 
 - In the *Alternating* folder the code and experiments to create a stream analysis model is present.
 - The *Evaluate_KValues* folder contains the final ITMM model (ARMAXKhronos_K.py) and contains the RUN file that simulates and generates the results for all experiments.
 - The *qt_vision* folder makes a QT live demo to compare Khronos to the ITMM.
 - The util folder contains code that was used to expirement and come up with solutions that worked well for this research.
 
 ## Results
 
  The data and the results of all simulations can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TZ8tLasbf9iYgiz8aXdOejPKRvb1MnTD?usp=sharing
